#+DESCRIPTION: Repl Jack is a utility for connecting to a remote node application utilizing one or more node js REPLs.

[[https://github.com/mikedmcfarland/repl-jack][Repl Jack]] is a utility for connecting to a remote node application utilizing one or more node js REPLs.

Essentially you run a Jack server, giving it a context for your REPLs. Then any client connecting to the jack will be given its own node js
REPL. This allows you to run a node js application on a remote server, run this Jack alongside it, and have multiple REPLs jack into the running applications.

This can be very helpful for debugging or executing commands in a running server in real time.

* installation
You can use npm to install : =npm install repl-jack=

* Running a jack
** Command Line
A command line script, jack-make is included that can host the jack and
create a context. Here's an example:

#+begin_src sh

# make a jack, and run FooModule and insert it into the REPL context
jack-make -c FooModule
#+end_src

To see its usage use --help

#+begin_example

$ jack-make --help                                                                                                                                                            1 â†µ

Usage: run-jack-make [options]

Options:
   -s, --start     starting port, this is the port that clients will need to use to connect  [9001]
   -e, --end       ending port, the server will utilize the range of ports from start to end for handshaking and REPLs  [9006]
   -c, --context   comma seperated list of modules to require and add to the context  []
#+end_example

** Node API
Here's the node jS API

#+begin_src js

var FooModule = require('FooModule');
var Jack = require('repl-jack');

var jack = new Jack({
  context : { FooModule : FooModule},
  ports : [9001,9002,9003]
});
#+end_src

* Connecting to a jack
A command line script, jack-connect, is included that can connect to the
REPL jack. Example:

#+begin_src sh

#connect to a jack at 172.16.254.1 running on port 9001
jack-connect -h 172.16.254.1 -p 9001
#+end_src

To its usage use --help

#+begin_example
$ run-jack-connect --help

Usage: jack-connect [options]

Options:
   -h, --host
   -p, --port   the port of the jack to connect to (should be the start port)  [9001]
#+end_example

* Development
This is written in es6. There are a few build tasks that utilize gulp
that allow you to test and run the applications in node. =gulp
run-jack-connect= and =gulp run-jack-make= should get you started when
making changes.
