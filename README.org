* Development
A reasonable local development setup would be to run the dev server and jest

#+begin_src sh
open http://localhost:3000
yarn dev
#+end_src

and in a separate terminal
#+begin_src sh
yarn watch:test
#+end_src

* Commands

| yarn dev        | run development server                    |
| yarn test:watch | run jest tests while watching for changes |
| yarn build      | run next build                            |
| yarn export     | run next export, creates files for SSG    |
| yarn lint       | run next lint                             |
| yarn test       | run jest tests                            |

* Org integration
The org sources aren't used directly, the site depends on json files produced by [[https://github.com/jlumpe/ox-json][ox-json a JSON export back end for Emacs Org mode]].
I played quite a bit with things like [[https://github.com/orgapp/orgajs][orgajs]] and eventually decided it would be simplier to just have a json export in emacs, and look at that, it exists.
